**symbol** (str): The trading pair symbol to fetch data for (default: `'BTCUSDT'`).\n","- **num_days** (int): The number of past days to retrieve data (default: 7).\n","\n","#### Imports and Configuration\n","This function relies on:\n","- The **Binance API** to fetch 1-minute interval OHLCV data.\n","- Configuration variables from `config.py`:\n","  - `SYMBOLS_CSV_PATH`: Path to CSV file with trading symbols.\n","  - `START_TIME`: Start date and time for data collection.\n","  - `NUM_DAYS`: Number of days to fetch for each symbol.\n","  - `OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH`: Path where CSV files are saved.\n","\n","#### Process Overview\n","1. **Setup**:\n","   - Converts `START_TIME` from `config.py` to a datetime object.\n","   - Initializes an empty DataFrame to hold all the retrieved data.\n","\n","2. **Data Collection**:\n","   - Loops over each day within the specified `num_days`, fetching data in chunks of 1,000 records due to API limits.\n","   - Each call to the Binance API retrieves data for a specific `symbol` from `startTime`, using `interval='1m'` to capture per-minute data.\n","   - If data is received, it is converted into a DataFrame and appended to `all_data`. The loop continues until reaching the end of the current day or if no further data is available.\n","\n","3. **Data Processing**:\n","   - Ensures the `Open Time` column is converted to a readable UTC datetime format for easy analysis.\n","   - Sorts all data by `Open Time` in ascending order, ensuring chronological order.\n","\n","4. **Data Export**:\n","   - Saves the aggregated data as a CSV file in `OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH`, named as `<symbol>_per_minute_data.csv`.\n","   - Each file contains columns such as `Open Time`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, `Close Time`, `Quote Asset

includes various metrics that provide insights into the asset's trading activity over time. Here’s a breakdown of each field and its purpose:\n","\n","1. **Open Time**\n","   - **Type**: Timestamp (in milliseconds, converted to datetime)\n","   - **Purpose**: Marks the beginning of each trading period (1-minute intervals in this case), helping to organize and sequence the data chronologically.\n","\n","2. **Open**\n","   - **Type**: Float\n","   - **Purpose**: The price of the asset at the start of the interval. Useful for tracking price trends and understanding how the price moves over short periods.\n","\n","3. **High**\n","   - **Type**: Float\n","   - **Purpose**: The highest price of the asset during the interval. This is often used to measure volatility or to identify resistance levels in technical analysis.\n","\n","4. **Low**\n","   - **Type**: Float\n","   - **Purpose**: The lowest price of the asset during the interval. Like the high price, it helps measure volatility and can indicate support levels.\n","\n","5. **Close**\n","   - **Type**: Float\n","   - **Purpose**: The price of the asset at the end of the interval. The closing price is often used as a key indicator in technical analysis and forms the basis for various moving averages.\n","\n","6. **Volume**\n","   - **Type**: Float\n","   - **Purpose**: The total trading volume during the interval. High volume indicates significant trading interest and can confirm the strength of price movements.\n","\n","7. **Close Time**\n","   - **Type**: Timestamp (in milliseconds, converted to datetime)\n","   - **Purpose**: Marks the end of each trading interval, complementing the open time and helping to define each 1-minute period.\n","\n","8. **Quote Asset Volume**\n","   - **Type**: Float\n","   - **Purpose**: The total volume traded in terms of the quote currency (e.g., USDT for BTCUSDT). This metric shows the overall value of trades in the quote currency and is another indicator of liquidity.\n","\n","9. **Number of Trades**\n","   - **Type**: Integer\n","   - **Purpose**: Represents the number of individual trades executed during the interval. High trade counts often indicate active trading and high liquidity.\n","\n","10. **Taker Buy Base Asset Volume**\n","    - **Type**: Float\n","    - **Purpose**: The volume of the base asset bought by takers (buyers who accept offers at market price) during the interval. It indicates buying demand and liquidity from market takers.\n","\n","11. **Taker Buy Quote Asset Volume**\n","    - **Type**: Float\n","    - **Purpose**: The volume in the quote currency for taker buy trades. This metric helps quantify the dollar value (or equivalent in quote currency) of buying interest from market takers.\n","\n","12. **Ignore**\n","    - **Type**: Placeholder\n","    - **Purpose**: This field is not used and can be ignored in analysis.\n","\n","Each of these fields contributes unique information that helps in analyzing trading patterns, price movement, and market sentiment. Together, they provide a comprehensive view of trading activity, allowing for in-depth technical analysis and potential strategy development.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":32,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","
